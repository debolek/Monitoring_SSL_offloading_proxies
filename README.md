# Monitoring_SSL_offloading_proxies
Task
 Imagine a server with the following specs:
● 4 times Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-4830 v4 @ 2.00GHz
● 64GB of ram
● 2 TB HDD disk space
● 2 x 10Gbit/s nics

The server is used for SSL offloading and proxies around 25000 requests per
second. Please let us know which metrics are interesting to monitor in that specific
case and how would you do that? What are the challenges of monitoring this?.
