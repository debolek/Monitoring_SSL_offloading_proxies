We need to know what is SSL offloading first before we proceed:-SSL offloading is the process of removing the SSL-based encryption from incoming traffic to relieve a web server of the processing burden of decrypting and/or encrypting traffic sent via SSL. The processing is offloaded to a separate device designed specifically for SSL acceleration or SSL termination.

Here are some of the key metrics you can monitor for a server used for SSL offloading and proxies for 2500 requests per second:

1. Response time: Monitor the response times of the server to ensure that it is meeting the desired response time goals and If the response times increase, it may indicate a problem with the server's performance or capacity.

2. CPU usage: Monitor the CPU usage of the server to ensure that the server is not overloaded with requests and in our case the request is around 25k request per seconds  and we need to have a metrics for the CPU Basic eg Busy System, Busy User ,Busy Iowait ,Busy IRQs , Busy Other and Idle .This can help you avoid performance issues and outages.
 
3. Memory usage: Keep track of the memory usage of the server. High utilization can lead to slow response times, page faults, and server crashes. In our case we are using 64GB of RAM so we need to have a monitoring panels for RAM Total RAM Used ,RAM Cache + Buffer , RAM Free and SWAP Used.

4. Network performance: Monitor the server's network performance, including network latency, packet loss(Network traffic by packet), and throughput. It can help you identify network capacity and congestion issues.
 
5. SSL Handshakes: Monitor SSL  handshake times; if the time for SSL handshake is too high, it can cause performance issues or impact user experience.

6. Errors and failures: Keep track of the number of requests that fail due to errors or other issues indicating problems with the application, infrastructure, and network.

7. Proxy response times: Monitor the response times of your proxy server to gauge their efficiency in handling 25K requests per second

8. Security events: Monitor the server for certain security events, including successful and unsuccessful login attempts, attack attempts, and other security-related events.

By monitoring these metrics, you can get a better understanding of your server's performance, detect issues early, and make data-informed decisions to optimize it for the best user experience


CHALLENGES
Monitoring a server used for SSL offloading and proxies around 2500 requests per second can be challenging due to several reasons:

1. High Volume of Data: Monitoring a server used for SSL offloading and proxies around 2500 requests per second can generate a large volume of data, making it challenging to handle, process and analyze the data generated by various monitoring tools.

2. Dynamic Load: The load on a server used for SSL offloading and proxies around 2500 requests per second can be highly dynamic, changing rapidly and unpredictably. Monitoring such a highly fluctuating load requires a sophisticated and flexible monitoring system that is capable of dynamically scaling up or down.

3. SSL Encryption: SSL offloading involves decrypting the incoming SSL traffic and re-encrypting it again before sending it to the backend servers. This adds an extra overhead to the server and monitoring the SSL encryption/decryption overhead can be challenging.

4. Resource Contention: Proxies used for 2500 requests per second can severely strain CPU, memory and network resources. Monitoring resource utilization is crucial for identifying resource bottlenecks to optimize server performance.

5. Security: Monitoring for malicious traffic attempting to bypass SSL offloading and proxies is essential. Additionally, detecting and resolving vulnerabilities and exploits can be tricky, and monitoring improves security posture.

In summary, effectively monitoring a server used for SSL offloading and proxies around 2500 requests per second involves dealing with technical complexity, real-time data acquisition and analysis, and security challenges.
